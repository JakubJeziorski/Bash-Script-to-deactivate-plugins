# Bash file that given the url and the plugin number renames the folder of this plugin to turn it off
This script is for my current hosting on Gridpane, once I found the plugin that is causing the issue, I can run this script and it will rename the folder of the plugin to "{name-of-theplugin}-copy" and then rename it back to orginal name. This action deactivates plugin and in most cases solves the crash of wordpress. 

[ ] Creat template file for Bash
[ ] Manually setup the comand and test if it is working
[ ] Add paramiters to the script so it takes URL and PLUGIN NAME as variables.
[ ] Test it on the server
